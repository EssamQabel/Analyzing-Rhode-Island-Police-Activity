# Analyzing Rhode Island Police Activity
Analyzing Rhode Island Police behavior, by asking multiple, and using python and pandas we can answer them.
In this project I use python and pandas to investigate some question related to the behaviour of the Rhode Island Police Department officers especially the relationship between gender and policing.
This project is presented in "Analyzing police activity with pandas" course on datacamp.com, and the dataset is a subset form the Stanford Open Policing Project dataset.
